# ML Experiments

Hi! This is my collection of learnings and experiments exploring what works (and what doesn't) in machine learning.

I am documenting what I am learning (as the machine's learning) and what I'd take away to build real ML products in the wild.

## Experiments

- **[rl-median-tinker](./rl-median-tinker.ipynb)** - Can RL teach an LLM to compute medians? Tests generalization across value ranges, list lengths, and model sizes.

## Why share this?

Most ML content shows polished results. This repo shows my messy parts: what breaks, where models struggle, and what that teaches me about building with AI.
